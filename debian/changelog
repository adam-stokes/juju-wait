juju-wait (2.0.1) precise; urgency=medium

  * Ensure we wait for at least a few seconds with 1.24 enanced status checks,
    to give a command executed immediately before 'juju wait' to be processed
    and have its hooks fired.

juju-wait (2.0.0) precise; urgency=medium

  * Use Juju 1.24 enhanced status, if available. Fallback if not.

    unexpected log messages. The new algorithm, when available,
    is much faster.

  * Add -v and -q options, despite fears that they will be
    incompatible with a 'wait' command added to juju-core.

  * Code is somewhat restructured to allow better embedding
    in tools such as Mojo.

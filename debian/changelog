juju-wait (2.0.0) precise; urgency=medium

  * Use Juju 1.24 enhanced status, if available. Fallback if not.
    The original algorithm was fragile, failing if certain Juju
    debugging options are enabled on the environment creating
    unexpected log messages. The new algorithm, when available,
    is much faster.

  * Add -v and -q options, despite fears that they will be
    incompatible with a 'wait' command added to juju-core.

  * Code is somewhat restructured to allow better embedding
    in tools such as Mojo.

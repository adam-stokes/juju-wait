Description: Juju plugin to wait for environment steady state.
 This plugin provides the following new juju command:
 .
    juju wait
 .
 This command waits until all hooks in the environment have completed
 running and there are no more queued to run. It is primarily used by
 deployment wrappers and test suites to know when a series on juju
 commands (which run asynchronously) have completed and the system is
 ready for the next step. Once the Juju environment has reached this
 stable state, it will remain stable until some action destabalizes it,
 such as operator action, machine reboots or scheduled tasks.
